# Change Log

## Unreleased

### Verified incremental checkpoint correction

- **Requirements:** P-04, P-14.
- **Decision:** Completed and empty discovery pages retain a durable source checkpoint
  for the next incremental pass (ADR-008).
- **Scope:** Contract correction and unit tests only. No device media or permission is
  accessed.
- **Verification:** On 2026-07-18, `AssetDiscoverySourceTest` passed in Android
  Studio: 3 of 3 tests passed after the correction.

### Verified source discovery contract

- **Requirements:** P-03, P-04, P-05, P-14, P-15.
- **Decision:** Discovery returns bounded, source-specific Asset pages and explicit
  access/failure outcomes (ADR-008).
- **Scope:** Pure Kotlin contract and unit tests only. No device media, document,
  provider, permission, worker, or UI is accessed or changed.
- **Verification:** On 2026-07-18, `AssetDiscoverySourceTest` passed in Android
  Studio: 3 of 3 tests passed. The emulator remained healthy during the run.

### Verified Memory evidence contract

- **Requirements:** P-09, P-10, P-11, P-12, P-13.
- **Decision:** A Memory is versioned by its Asset and every summary/anchor cites
  stored evidence (ADR-007).
- **Scope:** Pure Kotlin domain model and unit tests only. No source is opened, no AI
  is called, no derived content is persisted, and no visible behavior is changed.
- **Verification:** On 2026-07-18, `:app:testDebugUnitTest` passed, including the
  Memory contract tests. The unchanged welcome screen then launched successfully on
  the Medium Phone emulator.

### Verified dependency-injection foundation

- **Requirement:** P-17.
- **Decision:** Hilt 2.60.1 owns application composition (ADR-006), using the existing
  Android legacy KAPT compatibility bridge. Java 17 is configured as required by the
  current official Hilt/Compose setup guidance.
- **Scope:** Application, Room database/DAO/repository bindings, and the Android
  entry point only. No source access, indexing work, permission, network behavior,
  or visible UI behavior is added.
- **Verification:** On 2026-07-18, `:app:testDebugUnitTest` completed successfully;
  Hilt's generated tasks compiled the application graph. The existing automated test
  task was current. The unchanged welcome screen then launched successfully on the
  Medium Phone emulator.

### Verified persistence boundary

- **Requirements:** P-04, P-05, P-09, P-14, P-17.
- **Decision:** Room 2.8.4 with exported schemas; Android legacy KAPT is used for
  Room generation under the current AGP built-in Kotlin toolchain (ADR-005).
- **Verification status:** Initial KSP configuration was rejected by AGP before
  compilation. The documented compatibility path uses legacy KAPT. The Room schema
  path is supplied explicitly to legacy KAPT because the Room Gradle plugin does not
  propagate it through this compatibility bridge.
- **Verification:** `:app:testDebugUnitTest` passed with the generated Room schema.
  On 2026-07-18, `RoomAssetRepositoryTest` passed on the Medium Phone emulator:
  2 of 2 tests passed. The tests verify record round-trip persistence and idempotent
  upsert behavior for a stable source identity.

### Source-neutral domain foundation

- **Requirements:** P-03, P-04, P-05, P-09, P-14.
- **Layers:** Domain only; no UI, Android platform API, data persistence, network, or
  AI dependency was added.
- **Delivered:** Asset types, immutable source identity/location/fingerprint values,
  read-only source capability contract, and validated recoverable indexing lifecycle.
- **Verification:** `:app:testDebugUnitTest` passed on 2026-07-17. Tests cover identity
  validation, source capability safety, valid indexing flow, retry behavior, and
  rejected invalid transitions.
- **Known limitation:** This does not discover, open, persist, or search real assets.
  The next phase is a Room persistence boundary; automatic existing-note access remains
  blocked by ADR-003.
