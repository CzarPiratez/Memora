# Change Log

## Unreleased

### Source-neutral domain foundation

- **Requirements:** P-03, P-04, P-05, P-09, P-14.
- **Layers:** Domain only; no UI, Android platform API, data persistence, network, or
  AI dependency was added.
- **Delivered:** Asset types, immutable source identity/location/fingerprint values,
  read-only source capability contract, and validated recoverable indexing lifecycle.
- **Verification:** `:app:testDebugUnitTest` passed on 2026-07-17. Tests cover identity
  validation, source capability safety, valid indexing flow, retry behavior, and
  rejected invalid transitions.
- **Known limitation:** This does not discover, open, persist, or search real assets.
  The next phase is a Room persistence boundary; automatic existing-note access remains
  blocked by ADR-003.
