# Change Log

## Unreleased

### Verified persistence boundary

- **Requirements:** P-04, P-05, P-09, P-14, P-17.
- **Decision:** Room 2.8.4 with exported schemas; Android legacy KAPT is used for
  Room generation under the current AGP built-in Kotlin toolchain (ADR-005).
- **Verification status:** Initial KSP configuration was rejected by AGP before
  compilation. The documented compatibility path uses legacy KAPT. The Room schema
  path is supplied explicitly to legacy KAPT because the Room Gradle plugin does not
  propagate it through this compatibility bridge.
- **Verification:** `:app:testDebugUnitTest` passed with the generated Room schema.
  On 2026-07-18, `RoomAssetRepositoryTest` passed on the Medium Phone emulator:
  2 of 2 tests passed. The tests verify record round-trip persistence and idempotent
  upsert behavior for a stable source identity.

### Source-neutral domain foundation

- **Requirements:** P-03, P-04, P-05, P-09, P-14.
- **Layers:** Domain only; no UI, Android platform API, data persistence, network, or
  AI dependency was added.
- **Delivered:** Asset types, immutable source identity/location/fingerprint values,
  read-only source capability contract, and validated recoverable indexing lifecycle.
- **Verification:** `:app:testDebugUnitTest` passed on 2026-07-17. Tests cover identity
  validation, source capability safety, valid indexing flow, retry behavior, and
  rejected invalid transitions.
- **Known limitation:** This does not discover, open, persist, or search real assets.
  The next phase is a Room persistence boundary; automatic existing-note access remains
  blocked by ADR-003.
