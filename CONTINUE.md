## Current checkpoint

**Project:** Memora Android app

**Project folder:** `MemoraApp/`

**Current state:** Android Studio project is created and runs successfully on the
Medium Phone emulator. The app contains a welcome screen and a prototype photo
permission screen. The source-neutral Asset and indexing-state domain contracts are
implemented with local unit tests. Room persistence for Assets and indexing state is
implemented, its schema is exported to version control, and both local and
emulator-backed tests pass. Hilt now owns the application-level Room database and
repository bindings, and the unchanged app launches on the emulator. The app does
**not** yet discover, extract, understand, or search any asset. A source-neutral
Memory and evidence contract is now tested, but no Memory is persisted yet. The app
contains no real source adapter, WorkManager job, or AI integration. The read-only
source discovery contract and its incremental cursor model are tested, but no real
phone media has been opened or indexed.

The visible prototype is not the final product contract. In particular, the prior
idea of importing notes through Share is rejected as the primary workflow because it
does not satisfy automatic source indexing.

## Read in this order

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `docs/GOVERNANCE.md`
3. `docs/PRODUCT_CONTRACT.md`
4. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

7. `docs/PRD_TRACEABILITY.md`

No implementation begins until this read gate is complete and the next change is
mapped to its requirements, acceptance criteria, risks, and verification plan.

## Last verified behavior

- Gradle sync completed in Android Studio.
- The emulator starts and the app installs.
- `:app:testDebugUnitTest` passed after the source-neutral domain foundation was added.
- `:app:testDebugUnitTest` passed after adding Room persistence and exported schema
  version 1.
- `RoomAssetRepositoryTest` passed on the Medium Phone Android emulator on
  2026-07-18: 2 of 2 tests passed. It verifies record round-trip persistence and
  idempotent update behavior for a stable source identity.
- Hilt’s generated dependency graph compiled successfully with
  `:app:testDebugUnitTest` on 2026-07-18. The existing automated test task was
  current, and the unchanged welcome screen then launched successfully on the Medium
  Phone emulator.
- The Memory/evidence domain tests passed with `:app:testDebugUnitTest` on
  2026-07-18. The unchanged welcome screen launched successfully afterward on the
  Medium Phone emulator.
- `AssetDiscoverySourceTest` passed in Android Studio on 2026-07-18: 3 of 3 tests
  passed. It verifies bounded discovery, source-owned cursors, and rejection of mixed
  sources or duplicate identities. The emulator remained healthy during the run.
- Welcome screen displays the intended privacy-first language.
- Tapping setup can request image access and Android reports the result.

## Next approved engineering step

Plan the first platform adapter: read-only MediaStore discovery for photos and
screenshots. Before implementation, define its privacy boundary, stable identifiers,
incremental query strategy, and user-visible error/revocation behavior. Do not start
indexing or retain any user media until that plan and its tests are approved.

## Important open decision

The PRD requires automatic indexing of existing notes but also excludes user accounts
and cloud sync. Android cannot read private data from arbitrary note apps. A truthful
automatic note connector therefore needs a provider-specific, read-only connection
(for example, OneNote) or the MVP source definition must be narrowed. See ADR-003 in
`docs/DECISIONS.md`. Do not claim that all phone notes are automatically indexed until
this is resolved.
